# World Cup Database Project

This project is designed to demonstrate skills in creating, populating, and querying a PostgreSQL database. The data consists of World Cup game results from the final three rounds since 2014. This `README.md` file provides an overview of how the project was completed, including database creation, data insertion, and query execution.

## Project Overview

The project was completed in three main parts:

1. **Create the Database**:
   - Create the `worldcup` database and necessary tables.
2. **Insert Data**:
   - Populate the database with data from `games.csv`.
3. **Query the Database**:
   - Write SQL queries to extract information from the database and match the provided output specifications.
